## General info
---
Taste-Maker is an application that simplifies the process of **food choice** when ordering food from a restaurant or online food delivery store. A user filters the long list of food items by selecting his/her favourite ingredient.

There are too many food choices online and food lovers seek convenience in choosing what they feel like eating.
The websites that offer take-away food options like Yum, Uber Eats and Jumia foods have focused on importing menus that are not simplified.

The application allows the user to:

* Simplify the process of food choice

* Understand the basic ingredients in non-local cuisines, and order foods from these restaurants.
* Acquire a palate for different tastes and cuisines. For example, that having Chop Suey for dinner...is simply chinese meat stew.
