## General info
---
Taste-Maker is an application that simplifies the process of **food choice** when ordering food from a restaurant or online food delivery store. A user filters the long list of food items by selecting his/her favourite ingredient.

There are too many food choices online and food lovers seek convenience in choosing what they feel like eating.
The websites that offer take-away food options like Yum, Uber Eats and Jumia foods have focused on importing menus that are not simplified.

The application allows the user to:
* Simplify the process of food choice
* Understand the basic ingredients in non-local cuisines, and order foods from these restaurants.
* Acquire a palate for different tastes and cuisines. For example, that having Chop Suey for dinner...is simply chinese meat stew.

**User Story**
As a user I want to be able to reduce broad menu options to a select list of dishes based on my preferences. 

| Inputs|Outputs|User Behavior|
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Click button    |  Navigation to search page | User elects to begin search |
| Drop-down menu ingredient selected | Navigation to recipe page | Preference input |
| Return button         |   Takes user back to home page| User willingness to participate in process again|
